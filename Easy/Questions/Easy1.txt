Codathon2022 (E) Q11. Gross Salary

    Let's say you are an employee of organization. The organization determines the employees' salaries for a 30-days
period. If an employee is on leave, the string '0' is used to indicate this. On the other hand, the string "1" is used
to indicate that the employee is at work. Every day the employee X works, they are paid S rupees. The bonus is also
included with each employee if they work the longest consecutive stretch of days in a given month
(i.e., without taking any breaks). For the month's longest workweek, the corporation awards bonus B rupees.

Your task is to calculate the employee X's salary (including the bonus B).

Note: Only one longest streak will be counted if there are two or more of the same length.

Input:

(1) The first line denotes the number of test cases, T.

(2) Each test case's first line contains the two integers S and B. (S stands for the entire monthly compensation,
and B stands for the bonus for the consecutively longest working days during the month.)

(3) The second line is made up of strings of 0s and 1s. (0's indicate a leave of absence, and 1 indicates work).

Output:

For each test case, output is a single line i.e. the salary of the employee X (including the bonus).

Example:

Explanation:

Test case 1: 

Employee works for 17 days in the month and each day salary is 6000 /-. Therefore 17*6000 = 102000 /-. The length of
continuous working days are 5 (the last 5 working days). Each bonus day salary is 3000. Therefore, 5*3000 = 15000. The
total salary of the employee is 102000 + 15000 = 117000 /-.

Test case 2: 

Employee pay is 18*8000 = 144000 and bonus is 4*2000 = 8000. Total salary is 152000 /-.
