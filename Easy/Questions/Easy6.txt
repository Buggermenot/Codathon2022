Codathon2022 (E) Q23. Maximum Sum
You are given an array ARR of N integers. You have to maximize the sum of integers in an array.

Condition for choosing integers

The number of unique elements taken from an array should not be greater than K.

You are given T test cases.

Input format

The first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K denoting the length of the array and the
maximum number of distinct integers you can choose.

The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers denoting the integer array ARR.

Output format

You have to print the sum (maximum) obtained by taking some integers from an array by following the above conditions.
If you are not able to choose any element, output will be 0.

Constraints

1≤T≤1000

1≤K≤N≤5×10^5

−10^9≤Ai≤10^9

Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2×10^6
