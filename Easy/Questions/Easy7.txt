Codathon2022 (E) Q24. Bamboozled Game

Joey is playing a game with Ross and Chandler to practice for his audition. In this game, initially joey provides Ross
and Chandler with a list of n numbers. (The list is same for both of them but have their own copy).



Joey gives both of them different strategy to play the game.



Ross picks the element from start of his list. Chandler picks the element from the end of his list.



Help Joey, generate the result in form of an output list.



Method to be followed at each step of the game to build the output list is:



If the number picked by Ross is bigger than Chandler then the output at this step is 1 and Chandler removes the number
that was picked from his list. If the number picked by Ross is smaller than Chandler then this step's output is 2 .
Ross removes the number that was picked from his list. If both Ross and Chandler have the same number then this step's
output is 0 . Both Ross and Chandler  remove the number that was picked from their list.


This game ends when at least Ross or Chandler has no more elements to be picked i.e. when the list given to ross or
chandler gets empty.
