Codathon2022 (E) Q3. Decode the code to get the password

Mr. Stephen wants to send a message confidential password to his friend Bob. He has planned to send the message in
encoded form. For doing this he has planned two send two messages. In first message he has sent a 1-indexed array of
zeros. In another message a list of addition operations, for each operation add a value to each of the array element
between two given indices, inclusive. You are requested to help the Bob to decode the code and return the maximum value
in array after performing the operations.

For example, the length of your array of zeros n=10. Your list of queries is as follows:

    x y k

    1 5 3

    4 8 7

    6 9 1

Add the values of “k” between the indices “x” and “y” inclusive:

 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 <---index

[0,0,0, 0, 0,0,0,0,0, 0]

[3,3,3, 3, 3,0,0,0,0, 0]

[3,3,3,10,10,7,7,7,0, 0]

[3,3,3,10,10,8,8,8,1, 0]

The largest value is 10 after all operations are performed.

Sample Input

5 3                <--- first array size is 5 containing all zero’s second array size is 3

1 2 100          <--- Second array elements

2 5 100

3 4 100

Sample Output

200

Test Case1:

6 3

1 2 10

2 6 5

3 4 100

Sample Output

105
