Codathon2022 (H) Q1. “I” Shape Analysis in the given Data

A 2-D array having dimensions m*n where 2< m = n < 7 are given. The values stored in array lies in between
-5 < arr[i][j] <= 5. Calculate the “I” shape sum (sum of “I” shape values) for every “I” shape in array. Print the
maximum sum, I shape values along with position of the beginning row and column of the maximum sum “I” shape.

Example:

A 2-dimensional array having dimensions 5x5 is given below:

0 0 1 0 0

0 1 0 0 0

1 0 1 0 0

0 1 0 0 0

1 0 1 0 1



A “I” shape in the array is a subset of values having graphical representation:

a b c

  d

e f g



There are 9 “I” shape possible in the given array:



001 010 100

 1     0     0

101 010 100

010 100 000

 0     1     0

000 000 000

101 010  100

  1     0     0

101 010   101



Answer:

5                                  (sum)

101                              (Maximum Sum “I” shape)

 1

101

2 0                                (Maximum sum “I” shape starts from row 2 column 0)



Input Format

3

Each of the “m” lines of input array[i] contains “n” space-separated integers arr[i][j].

Constraints:



-5< arr[i][j] <=5

2< i, j <7

Output Format



Print the largest (maximum) “I” shape sum found in array

Print the largest (maximum) “I” shape

Print the starting row and column of maximum “I” shape

Sample Input:

6

1 1 1 0 0 0

0 1 0 0 0 0

1 1 1 0 0 0

0 0 2 4 4 0

0 0 0 2 0 0

0 0 1 2 4 0



Explanation:

First line contains dimensions 6*6 (m*n).

Second line onwards contains the 6 lines containing 6 space separated values.



Sample Output



19

2 4 4

2

1 2 4

3 2

Explanation



The “I” shape maximum sum is: 19

The “I” shape with the maximum sum (19) is:

2 4 4

  2

1 2 4

The “I” shape starting row is 3 and column is 2.
