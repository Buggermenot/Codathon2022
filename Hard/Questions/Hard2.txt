Codathon2022 (H) Q16. Robo Race

Joseph F. Engelberger wants to play a new game with N robots (where N is a positive odd integer and N>4). Every robot
has a unique integer ID. RIDi refers to the ID of ith robot. For this game, he considers a rectangular field
(playground) ABCD with 500 m long and 400 m wide. The coordinate of A, B, C, and D points are (0, 0), (0, 500),
(400, 500), and (400, 0) respectively. Joseph places one robot at point A, (N-1)/2 robots at different points on the
AD line, and the rest (N-1)/2 robots at different points on the AB line. Si is the source point and Di is the
destination point of a robot i. Every robot can move along in a straight line from source to destination. In this game
a robot is called winner if it reaches its destination without any collision with other robot. The initial velocity of
every robot is 0. At time T the game is started. A robot i starts moving towards its destination point after RIDi mod N
second from the starting of the game and its acceleration is (RIDi mod N)+1 cm/s. Write a C++ program to print the ID
of all winning robots in ascending order.

Input instruction: Take the value of N from the user. Along with this, take the ID, coordinate of source and destination
points of every robot from the user.

Input

5                                       <- Value of N

12 0 300 400 300                        <- ID, coordinate of source, coordinate of destination of 1st robot

13 0 200 400 200                        <- ID, coordinate of source, coordinate of destination of 2nd robot

11 0 0 400 500                          <- ID, coordinate of source, coordinate of destination of 3rd robot

23 200 0 200 500                        <- ID, coordinate of source, coordinate of destination of 4th robot

22 350 0 350 500                        <- ID, coordinate of source, coordinate of destination of 5th robot
