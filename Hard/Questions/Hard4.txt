Codathon2022 (H) Q8. Quality matching problem

Sheldon and Amy are on a date. Sheldon, being the typical geek, asks the Amy to find their friends name based on their
qualities.

Each friend has a name and K qualities (i.e., helpfulness, intelligence, friendliness, and others) which can be rated by
an  K-sized tuple (A1, A2, A3, ..., AK). Each quality Ai is an integer between 0 to L inclusive (i.e., a rating of each
quality is given between 0 to L inclusive). Sheldon tells Amy about N friends. For each friend, he tells her its name
and gives her the K-tuple describing its qualities.

Then, he plays a quiz with Amy. He gives Amy Q  tuples and ask her which friend they belong to. As Amy is a
neurobiologist and does not want to disappoint Sheldon, she tries to answer all the questions correctly. Help her in
this task.

Input:
The first line contains N, K, L and Q, the number of friends, the size of the K-tuple, the maximum value of any quality
and the number of questions that Sheldon asks.
    -   N lines follow. The next ith line contains a string which is the name of the ith friend and K space separated
        integer which are the qualities for the ith friend.
    -   Q lines follow. The next ith line contains K space separated integer denoting a K-tuple.

Output:
For each question, output the name of the friend that the K-tuple belongs to.
It is also possible that Sheldon is asking a trick question and the tuple doesn't describe any friend. In such a case,
output "Not my friend :P" (Quotes are for clarity)

Constraints:
1<=N<=100000
1<=K<=5
1<=L<=15
1<=Q<=100000
0<=Ai<=L
1<=Length of friends name<=10
Friends name will contain only lowercase alphabets [a-z].

Note:
No two friends will have the same K-tuple or name.
