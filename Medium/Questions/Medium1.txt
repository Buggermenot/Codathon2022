Codathon2022 ( M) Q10. Weight Cancellation problem

A teacher asks students to play a game in which students are represented by ‘S’ and are sitting in the form of N rows
and M columns. Let u be the maximum weight of the student and v be the smallest weight of the student. If any student’s
whose weight is equal to u or v then they disfigure the complete row and column of the matrix. More formally, if any
weight is equal to u or v and contains cell number (x, y), that is, S[x][y]=u or S[x][y]=v then, they disfigure all the
cells that have row x or column y.

Your task is to find the number of students left.

Input format

The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N and M.

Next N lines consist of M space-separated integers.

Output format

For each test case, print a single integer denoting the left out students.

Constraints

1≤T≤100000

1≤N∗M≤1e5

1≤S(i,j)≤1e5   ∀i∈[1,N]  ∀j∈[1,M]

Sum of N×M over all test cases does not exceed 1e6

Sample Input

1

3 3

8 8 3

6 2 4

12 1 2

Sample Output

2

Explanation

It is clear that max weight of the student is 12 and minimum is 1. Since the cell number of 12 is (3,1) all the cells
which have row three and column will be disfigured.

8 8 3

6 2 4

12 1 2

The minimum weight of the student is 1 so cell number is (3,2) so all the cells which have column number 2 and row
number 3 will also be disfigured.

8 8 3

6 2 4

12 1 2

Only left out weights of the students are 3 and 4 so answer is 2.
