Codathon2022 (M) Q12.Flipping Registrations

Let's say a computer programmer wants to sort the registration number of students. He is trying to sort the
registration numbers in increasing order by reversing some of his registration numbers. He came to the conclusion that
he can only reverse registration numbers whose element sums are at most Y. He observes that using this criterion to sort
the registration numbers is not always practicable. Could you assist him by reversing some registration numbers in a
subarray with a sum of at most Y to help him sort the registration numbers? The registration numbers need not be
essentially unique.

More formally, you are provided an array and an integer Y. By flipping some (or none) of the subarrays so that the sum
of all of their items is at most Y, you must sort the array in increasing order.

Input: (1) The number of test cases is indicated by an integer value on the first line.

(2) The length of the array and the largest sum of the subarray that can be reversed are indicated by the two integers
M and Y on the first line of each test case, respectively.

(3) The second line consists of the initial array.

Output: If the array can be sorted in a finite number of operations for each test case, print "YES," otherwise output
"NO." (Note that the output statement is not case-sensitive.)
