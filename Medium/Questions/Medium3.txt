Codathon2022 (M) Q15. Maximize profit problem

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala has recently announced the launch of his dream airline “Akasha”. Since Jhunjhunwala are new to
airline business so they have a single plane to operate between Mumbai and Chennai. To grow up the business Akasha
airline has a tie up with the giant airlines like VISTARA and AIR INDIA. During the festive seasons, when the customer
rush is quite high, giant airlines rent the airplanes to accommodate the customer load. Airlines sent their order
request mentioning the duration for which they want to hold the aircraft. During heavy rush durations many airlines
submit their request to Akasha for their aircarfts. Hence, due to limited availability, few requests should be declined.
However, to maximize the profit the optimal solution must be computed with minimal rejections and maximum approvals.

Let us consider an scenario in which the Akasha airline received four requests:

Request 1: (Start time=0, Duration = 5, Cost = 10)

Request 2: (Start time=3, Duration = 7, Cost = 8)

Request 3: (Start time=5, Duration = 9, Cost = 7)

Request 4: (Start time=6, Duration = 9, Cost = 8)

In the above scenarios, if the request 2 and 3 are rejected then the gain is 10+8 = 18. It is worth noting that
accepting request 1 and 3 is feasible but this solution is not the optimal one.

Input

First line of test case has number of requests R i.e. R <= 10000. This is followed by number of requests. Each request
has 3 integer values representing start time (T), duration of request (D) and cost (S) customer to pay for the order.
The constraints are as follows: 0<=T<1000000, 0<D<1000000 and 0<S<1000000.

Output.

Task is to determine the optimal solution for the requests received. For each test case print the total cost paid by
the airlines for renting the aircraft.
