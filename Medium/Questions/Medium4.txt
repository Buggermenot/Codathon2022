Codathon2022 (M) Q18. Visit the Field

A farmer has a field in the shape of tetrahedron. He wants to create a spherical moving path inside the field touching
all the sides of the field. As he is a clever person so, he wants to create a path for the lazy people. For this, he
wants to consider the distance between centre of the field and the boundary of the spherical shape. You must help him
to find the path from center to spherical boundary. (i.e. a sphere tangent to all the faces).

Input

The first single line is for the number N of test cases. ( N <= 20 ) The 6 integer number for each of the next N -- the
lengths of the sides of a tetrahedron separated by single spaces. The higher limit of edges are 1000
(not greater than 1000) and for the tetrahedron ABCD, the order of the edges is: AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD.

Output

N lines, each consisting of a real number given with four digits decimal precision equal to the radius of a sphere
inscribed in the given tetrahedron.
