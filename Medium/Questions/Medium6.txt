Codathon2022 (M) Q20. Find Odd pairs

An array of length at least 3 having distinct integers is oddie iff  second highest odd element lies to the left of the
highest odd value. For example, [1, 2, 13, 10,  15, 12, 17] is oddie as the second-highest value 15 lies to the left of
highest value 17.
For every oddie array, we define a odd pair (i,j)  i denotes the index of the second-highest odd value (1-indexed) and
j denotes the index of the highest odd value (1-indexed). In the above array, the odd pair is (5, 7) [Assumption: Array
index starts from 1].
Given an array, find the total number of distinct pairs over all its subarrays.

Input:
The first line contains an integer N denoting the length of the array. The next line contains N distinct integers
denoting the elements of the array.

Output:
Output a single integer which is the answer to the problem.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 106
1 <= array elements <= 109
Array elements are distinct.

Sample Input

5

1 3 2 4 5

Sample Output

2

Explanation

Let us consider all the subarrays of the given array.
The subarray [1] ,  subarray [2], subarray [3], subarray [4], subarray [5] are not oddie.
Subarray [1, 3], subarray [3, 2], subarray [2, 4], subarray [4,5] are not oddie.
The odd pair for subarray [1, 3, 2] is (1,2).
The subarray [3, 2, 4] is not oddie.

The odd pair for subarray [1, 3, 2, 4] is (1,2).
The odd pair for subarray [1, 3, 2, 4,5] is (2, 5).
So, there are the 2 distinct pairs, which are (1, 2), and (2, 5).
