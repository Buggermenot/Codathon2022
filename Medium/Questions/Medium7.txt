Codathon2022 (M) Q4. Plants life matter

Mr. XYZ is fond of gardening. There are several plants in his garden. Due to insects in the plants, he has treated
each of the plants with some amount of pesticide. Mr. XYZ observed that after each day, if any plant A has more
pesticide than the plant B which is on its right side, then plant A dies. The plant A will not die if right side
plant B is not available (for last plant).

The initial value of pesticide in each plant is given in a 1D array as an input. Determine the total number of plants
dies in each day and the number of days after which no plant dies.

Example

P = [3,6,2,7,5]  // pesticide quantity

Use a 1-indexed array. On day 1, plants 2 and 4 die leaving p’= [3,2,5]. On day 2, plant 1 dies leaving p’= [2,5].
There is no plant with a higher concentration of pesticide than the one to its left and right, so plants stop dying
after day 2.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer , the size of the array .

The next line contains  space-separated integers .

Constraints

1<=n<=20

0 < = p[i] <= 100

Sample Input

7              <-- Input array size

6 5 8 4 7 10 9       <-- Input array value

Sample Output

4    <--Total number of Plants die

2     <-- Plants stop die after day 2
