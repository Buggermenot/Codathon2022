Codathon2022 (M) Q5. Beware! : Mines are There

Mr. XYZ has given a rectangular area containing m*n tiles where 3< m, n <=6. Each tile is filled with O or X or M,
where O represents an open tile, X represents a blocked tile and M represents landmines in the tile. Write a code to
help Mr. XYZ to find the shortest distance of every open tile from its nearest mine.

Constraints:

You are allowed to move either of the four directions (diagonal moves are not allowed). You can assume tiles with the
mine have distance 0, blocked and unreachable tiles have distance -1.

Example:

Input:

6 5                <--Array dimensions

O   M   O   O   X                 <--Input array values

O   X   X   O   M

O   O   O   O   O

O   X   X   X   O

O   O   M   O   O

O   X   X   M   O



Output:



1   0   1   2  -1

2  -1  -1   1   0

3   2   3   2   1

3  -1  -1  -1   2

2   1   0   1   2

3  -1  -1   0   1

Test Case 1:

Input:

4 4

O X X M

M X O O

O O M O

O O O O

Output:

1 -1 -1 0

0 -1 1 1

1 1 0 1

2 2 1 2
